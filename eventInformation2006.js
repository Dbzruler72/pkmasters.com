/** Event Information for 2006
For ['victor'], use initials.
If no description, leave 'description' blank: ''
If no video, leave ['video'] array blank: []
If no images, leave 'baseURL' blank: ''
	AND set imageTotal == 0
If no run-ins occured, completely disregard every parameter after ['video'], which means do not include ['clanAbbreviation'], [pkmStart], [pkmEnd], [clanStart], [clanEnd], ['victor']

For clarification, baseURL is the complete URL before the image number and extension.  For example, "001.png" is not included in baseURL.
For clarity, add a line break after each method.
