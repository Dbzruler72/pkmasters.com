# \*-P.K.Masters-\*  website
After closing the clan in 2010, I let the website and forum remain largely untouched, aside from a few backend forum updates.  Over the past 10 years, I've felt particularly bad that the website Events page sat contentless, which occurred after I discovered inconsistent behavior in Firefox and Safari that crashed the browsers.  Old  \*-PK.M-\*  members deserve a working website to remember the old days.


# Plans
I'm rewriting the entire website while preserving the original aesthetic, bad design decisions and all.  The markup and code need to be written to modern-day standards and practices so that the site is as future proof as possible.  The website especially needs to adapt to mobile devices.


# Current Status
Work in progress.  See the [dev branch](../../tree/dev) for the latest update.


# Dependencies
* Support for server-side includes.  Examples: Apache, Nginx


# License
