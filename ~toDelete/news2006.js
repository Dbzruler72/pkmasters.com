addNews('', 'Friday, December 29, 2006', 'Dbzruler72', '<div class="paragraph">Originally, I had planned for this this layout to come out Sunday, but I managed to put on some extra hours &amp; finish it a few days early.  The old website layout pretty much only revolved around the RuneScape section of the clan.  With this new layout, everything should be much easier to navigate.  To use the RuneScape section of the clan, just click on the button at the top.  For the Tiberian Sun/Firestorm section, click on the button at the top-right.  To use the Le Parkour/Freerunning section, click on the button at the top-left.  The appropriate links are now in the appropriate sections so u don\'t have Tiberian Sun/Firestorm content in the RuneScape section for example.  As u can see, the news now displays different.  Much of the pages have been altered so u may have to spend some time getting used to the new layout.  The links that don\'t directly include RuneScape, Tiberian Sun/Fiirestorm, &amp; Le Parkour/Freerunning are on the main page.  The old polls have been erased, &amp; I\'ve put up a new one.  If u ever encounter any broken links just send me a PM on the official  *-P.K.Masters-*  forums, but I think they should all be working--I\'ll double-check later on.  In addition to the new layout, the website should load much faster than before, so now u won\'t have to wait for the JavaScript features to kick in.  I hope everyone finds great use of the new website, I spend over 18 hours creating it {\;-)</div>');
